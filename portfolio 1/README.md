## Analysing Cycling Data

#Description
I analyse some cycling data in this repository. The dataset includes some cycling related measures as well as gps location and speed measures. The dataset was provided to me in my datascience unit at Macquarie.

#Table of Contents
- Exploring the 4 datasets.
- Creating a summary description for each ride
- Comparing the speeds of time trials with road races and using a lineplot to visualise the results
- Comparing the speeds of the two time trials and using a lineplot to visualise the results
- Creating a speed-elevation gain boxplot to visualise the correlation
- Calculating development(the distance travelled with one spin of the pedals) using speed and cadence information.Creating a histogram for each race to visualise the development distribution. Later creating a correlation plot to see the relation between speed, cadence and development.
